# Optimized requirements for Raspberry Pi Zero W
# Minimal dependencies to reduce memory footprint

# Core camera functionality
picamera2

# Web framework (lightweight)
flask

# Basic image processing (lighter than opencv-python)
# Note: Install system packages instead of pip for better Pi Zero W compatibility:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy

# For notification features (optional - can be disabled)
requests

# For system monitoring
psutil

# System monitoring
# Note: iwconfig should be available on most Raspberry Pi OS installations

# Installation notes for Pi Zero W:
# 1. Use system packages where possible: sudo apt install python3-picamera2 python3-flask
# 2. For OpenCV: sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-numpy
# 3. Only install requests via pip: pip3 install requests
# 4. Consider using virtual environment to manage dependencies
